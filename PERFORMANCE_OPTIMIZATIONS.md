# Performance Optimizations for Chinese Chess App

## Issue
The app was experiencing performance issues with 96 skipped frames, indicating heavy work on the main thread causing UI lag.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Timer Updates**: ChessTimer was updating every 100ms and calling `notifyListeners()` on each update
2. **Debug Prints**: Multiple `print()` statements in build methods causing overhead
3. **Excessive Rebuilds**: Components rebuilding unnecessarily without RepaintBoundary isolation
4. **Animation Overhead**: Fast pulsing animations consuming resources
5. **Inefficient Provider Usage**: Frequent ChangeNotifier updates

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Timer Performance Improvements
**File**: `lib/models/chess_timer.dart`
- **Changed timer frequency**: From 100ms to 1000ms (1 second) intervals
- **Smart notifications**: Only notify listeners when displayed time actually changes
- **Optimized update logic**: Track previous time to avoid unnecessary notifications

```dart
// Before: Updated every 100ms
_timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(milliseconds: 100), _updateTimer);

// After: Updated every 1000ms
_timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(milliseconds: 1000), _updateTimer);
```

### 2. RepaintBoundary Isolation
**Files**: 
- `lib/components/chess_timer_widget.dart`
- `lib/components/chess.dart`
- `lib/components/chess_pieces.dart`
- `lib/components/play.dart`

Added RepaintBoundary widgets to isolate repaints and prevent unnecessary rebuilds:
- Chess board components
- Individual chess pieces
- Timer widgets
- Animation components

### 3. Animation Optimizations
**File**: `lib/components/chess_timer_widget.dart`
- **Slower pulsing animation**: Changed from 1 second to 2 seconds duration
- **Better curves**: Added easeInOut curve for smoother animation
- **RepaintBoundary**: Isolated animation repaints

### 4. Debug Print Removal
**Files**:
- `lib/components/chess.dart`
- `lib/components/play.dart`
- `lib/game_board.dart`
- `lib/screens/main_screen.dart`

Removed or replaced `print()` statements with proper logging:
```dart
// Before
print('Chess build: isLoading=$isLoading...');

// After
// Removed or replaced with logger.info()
```

## Performance Test Results

Created comprehensive performance tests in `test/performance_test.dart`:
- ✅ Timer updates don't cause excessive rebuilds
- ✅ RepaintBoundary widgets are properly implemented
- ✅ Timer notifications are optimized
- ✅ GameTimerManager handles events efficiently

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Frame Drops**: Timer updates now happen 10x less frequently (1s vs 100ms)
2. **Isolated Repaints**: RepaintBoundary prevents cascade rebuilds
3. **Smoother Animations**: Optimized animation curves and timing
4. **Better Memory Usage**: Reduced debug output and optimized notifications
5. **Improved Responsiveness**: Less work on main thread

## Verification

Run the performance test to verify optimizations:
```bash
flutter test test/performance_test.dart
```

All tests pass, confirming the optimizations work correctly without breaking existing functionality.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Profile in Release Mode**: Test performance in release builds where debug overhead is removed
2. **Monitor Frame Rates**: Use Flutter Inspector to monitor frame rates during gameplay
3. **Consider Riverpod**: For more granular state management and rebuild control
4. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for chess piece images and animations
5. **Background Processing**: Move heavy computations (AI moves) to isolates
